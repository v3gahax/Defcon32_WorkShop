Red Team vs Med Team: Defcon

Topics:

What is adversarial medical device testing?
What are some tools/topics to help me get started?

Points:
- We need better medical device and medical testing going on to curb bad tendencies
- We will have only about a week to complete work and need to be swift, fast and lethal
- Post exploit like a mf to find more things

Dangerous Things:

Hl7 - Go over the dangers and show attack, let students perform attack
* HL7 Death exercise
* HL7 crashing scenario - HL7

DICOM - Go over dicom issues and vulns (go back to the topic later)

Board Analysis and Attacks:
- Identifying chips/inputs on the board/boards themselves
- DMA Attack

Peripheral Inputs:
* USB (Bash Bunny, FlipperZero, KonBoot)
* Ethernet (Throwing Star)
* Other/BLE (FlipperZero)

Access Bypasses:
* Kiosk Escape
* HID Bypasses
* Picking Locks

Go over DICOM port exploit to windows.

Once we get on systems:

Go over AppLocker Bypasses
* Simple Bypasses
* Advanced Coding Bypasses
* Ghost Loading with trusted binaries
* Advanced Bypass for Applocker
* Hells Gate: https://github.com/florylsk/SignatureGate

Post Exploitation
* Sensitive data searches
* Binary reverse engineering
